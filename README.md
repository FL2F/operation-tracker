# Operation Tracker for Facilitator of the workshop

## App is intended to monitor whether or not students have completed certain tasks. An additional feature is to have the facilitator click a button and have specific emails being sent out to the students.

## App built with React, Redux Toolkit, Express, and is hosted on the google cloud.

The purpose of this app is to replace the [google sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRkCXACAhhcN5Sbpkv4FjjbRf2ttC3mQKVIs6KL_YWg/edit#gid=0) that was used before.

## ToDo and bugs to fix

- We need to pull in information about the user's 1 on 1 scheduled meetins and add create an email template that reads the 1 on 1 info.
- Have Devin check the app to see if there are other features that he thinks we should add.
- Randomly assign DAN or DANA to each member
